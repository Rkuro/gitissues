Used  two  TRDB-­ D5M  cameras\nside  by  side  to  capture  object  signal  separately.  Solved  the  timing  problems.\nl The  signal  is  processed  by  ROW-­ to-­ RGB  module,  RGB-­ to-­ GRAYSCALE  module,  GRAYSCALE-­ to-­\nSOBLE  module.  Also,  used  erosion  algorithm  to  eliminate  the  noise  signal  (RTL  for  algorithms).\nl Used  Sum  Absolute  Difference(SAD)  to  calculate  the  pixels  difference(disparity),  and  calculate  the\ndepth  from  the  camera  to  the  object.\nOnline  Shopping  Store                                                         Jun  2015\nl Designed  web  pages  by  using  JavaScript  and  friendly-­ user  interface  by  using  Visual  Studio.\nl Created  a  database  in  SQL  server  to  store  the  information  like  goods'  and  customers'  information.\nl Enhanced  business  intelligence  purpose  by  creating  multiple  store  procedures  and  triggers.\nl Connected  the  database  to  the  web  page  by  using  Visual  Studio  with  C#.\nDesign  and  a  8-­ bit  Multiplier  using  ON/AMI  0.6μm  Technology                        Nov  2014\nl Added  mux  tree  for  chip  test.  The  mux  tree  was  designed  to  test  the  multiplier  module  and  the\nbinary-­ to-­ BCD  module.\nl Used  Cadence  Virtuoso  to  design  the  schematic  and  layout  for  all  kinds  of  modules  of  multiplier.\nl DRC  and  LVS  report  analysis  was  done  for  each  module.\nl Used  both  test  bench  and  the  Verilog  to  do  the  simulations  of  each  module.\nFPGA  games  based  on  EEG  mind  wave                                            May  2015\nl Analyzed  the  EEG  data  which  reflect  the  thought  of  brain.\nl Used  the  attention  value  got  from  the  raw  data  and  did  the  digital  signal  processing  connected\nthe  EEG  equipment  with  the  raspberry  pi  and  the  FPGA  board.\nl Implemented  the  FPGA  game  controlled  both  by  camera  and  the  attention  value  from  our  mind.\nTechnical  &  Programming  Skills\nProgramming:  C/C++, Java, Verilog/VHDL, Testing.\nDatabases:  SQL Server, MySQL Design Skills: ASIC Design, RF design.\nTools:  Microsoft SQL Server, Visual Studio, Cadence Virtuoso, ADS, Modelsim, MATLAB, Design\nVision, Silvaco, Quartus II, Eclipse, Xcode.\nPublications\nJerry  Wu,  Harold  Szu,  Xixi  Gu,  Yuechen  Chen,  Ran  Guo.
