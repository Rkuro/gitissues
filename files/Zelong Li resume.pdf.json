Date: May. 2017\nB.S. Electrical Engineering and Computer Science\nWORKING EXPERIENCE\nZhuge IO Beijing, China\nSoftware Engineer Intern July, 2016 --- August, 2016\nInterned in Zhuge IO, a SAAS company in Beijing that provides data analytic service for other Internet companies.\nMainly focused on developing several API interfaces using Flask and Flask RESTful for connecting databases and\ngenerating statistics of individual user information, status change over a certain duration and functional uses of the\ncompany's service. The interface helped the company analyze user behaviors and lifecycle of users.\nBank of China & IBM China Beijing, China\nSoftware Engineer Intern June, 2015 --- August, 2015\nInterned in a team from IBM China working in the head quarter of Bank of China for developing an online shopping\nsystem that users could directly purchase merchandize by bank credits. Made the requirement analysis from the project\ninitiation and used HTML, JSP and SQL Server for creating merchandize display page and managing the user\ninformation.\nACCOMPLISHMENT\nMap Reduce Project\nUsed the Apache Spark framework to turn Breadth-first traversal to a format compatible with MapReduce framework\nand used Amazon Web Services Elastic Compute Cloud (AWS EC2) servers to solve large-scale puzzle sliding\nproblem.\nWan Optimizer\nImplemented a middlebox application that optimizes the amount of data transmitted over a wide area network (WAN)\nand the sending and receiving clients are unaware of the middleboxes that do the optimizations.\nGlucose Bond\nDesigned and implemented an app for android smartphone and smart watch called Glucose Bond. Focused on users\nwhose children were diagnosed as Type 1 Diabetes and parents who wanted to learn how to take care of their children\nwith diabetes. The app included features of forum, learning sources and mentorship. Also, an additional feature of\nphone-watch communication was implemented. Finished the whole design cycle including initial ideas, low fidelity\nprototyping, user testing, high fidelity prototyping, and demonstration for public showcase.\nCOURSEWORK\nComputer Science: Artificial Intelligence, Computer Architecture, Data Structure, Database, Efficient Algorithms, User\nInterface Design, Internet Architecture and Protocols and Computer Security\nElectrical Engineering: Microelectronic Circuits, Signal Processing\nIndustrial Engineering and Operations Research: Linear Programming\nBusiness Management: Microeconomic Analysis for Business Decisions, International Consulting","experience":"Zhuge IO Beijing, China\nSoftware Engineer Intern July, 2016 --- August, 2016\nInterned in Zhuge IO, a SAAS company in Beijing that provides data analytic service for other Internet companies.\nMainly focused on developing several API interfaces using Flask and Flask RESTful for connecting databases and\ngenerating statistics of individual user information, status change over a certain duration and functional uses of the\ncompany's service.
