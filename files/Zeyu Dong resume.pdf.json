Statistics, GPA: 3.8/4.0\nBeijing Institute of Technology, College of Math, Beijing, China September 2010-July 2014\nBS in Math, GPA: 3.3/4.0\nInternship Experience\nFindream, New York, USA December 2016 – Present\nData Analyst\nExtracted personal financial information from different databases and conducted EDA and data mining methods to find potential credit\npattern in user data\nIdentified the potential credit risks and fraud trends by establishing logistic regression model in Python with 75.4% accuracy\nImproved LR model in Python through a linear combination of XGboosting, Random Forest (decision tree based), and SVM with 5.3% more\naccuracy\nVisualized analysis results to senior management team to support data-driven business decision\nArecy, New York, USA May 2016 – December 2016\nTrainee\nEstablished a real-time stock-analyzer platform with data ingestion layer (Kafka), data storage layer (Cassandra, NoSQL database), data\ncomputation layer (Apache Spark)\nCreated Zookeeper container in Docker machine to assist Kafka to fetch real-time stock price from Google Finance and Redis container to\nassist Kafka to filter data to dashboard\nDesigned front-end dashboard to visualize real-time stock analysis with node.js, D3.js, jQuery and JavaScript for clients\nMass Mutual Financial Group, Hong Kong January 2013-June 2013\nManagement Trainee\nImplemented table
