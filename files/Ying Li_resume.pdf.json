Reported\ndata to manager, which helped investors make informed market decisions.\nx Implemented and compared multiple models like ARIMA and ETS for advanced Baker-Hughes rig forecast and\ncreated R markdown report.\nx Utilized AGILE development (Kanban) and Atlassian Suite (BitBucket, JIRA, and Confluence) to collaborate with\ncolleagues on multiple projects.\nRELATED PROJECT EXPERIENCE\nWeb scraping and Analyzing of Real Estate Property Data Using Python Feb. 2017\nx Created and applied a web crawler to Century 21 webpages. Acquired the content on the pages using the Requests\nLibrary and parsed out the files formatted in HTML using the BeautifulSoup Library.\nx Inspected and iterated the elements from the webpages sourcecode. Identified the rules and grabbed target data.\nx Solved exceptional situations of the text with further methods. Cleaned the data and stored output data into a csv file.\nSpam Detection Filter with Natural Language Processing Using Python Feb 2017\nx Explored the corpus of SMS messages and performed data visualization with the Seaborn and Matplotlib.\nx Applied tokenization on the messages and removed the punctuations and stop words with nltk library.\nx Conducted vectorization and converted each of the messages into a vector using bag-of-words model. Acquired the\nsparse matrix and converted the entire bag-of-words corpus into a TF-IDF corpus with Scikit Learn library.\nx Trained and compared the spam/ham classifier with Naïve Bayes and Random Forest classifier algorithm. Made\npredictions and created classification reports.\nx Created a data pipeline to set up all the transformation to the data for future use.\nRed Wine and White Wine Quality Analysis Using R Dec. 2016\nx Performed PCA and clustering methods including hierarchical clustering and K-Means clustering on white and red\nwine datasets in order to compare data distribution.\nx Compared the results of best subset selection, forward stepwise selection, backward stepwise selection and LASSO\nfor variable selection.\nx Implemented the models of logistic regression with multiple classes, decision trees, random forest and K-nearest\nneighbors with the selected variables and compared the predictive results to the testing data sets.\nx Implemented a wine identifier model to determine which quality prediction method should be used with KNN method\nwith an accuracy of 98.7%.\nTECHNICAL SKILLS\nR, Python, SAS, SQL, Tableau, STATA, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, PHP, JAVA, Go, C++Web scraping and Analyzing of Real Estate Property Data Using Python Feb. 2017\nx Created and applied a web crawler to Century 21 webpages.
