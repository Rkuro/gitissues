I am applying for the position of Software Engineer. This\ncover letter aims to show how my skills and ambitions fit the position described.\nI am currently an Information Science major at Columbia University and I consider\nmyself to have an ample amount of coding experience, both in the classroom and in a\nprofessional environment. During my internship as a Quantitative Developer this past\nSummer at Quest Partners LLC, I worked on numerous projects which used a range of\ndifferent technologies. The biggest project involved developing a full stack web\napplication which displayed in real-time the profit and loss of various fund strategies.\nThis involved a Python, MongoDB back end and a Node.js, AngularJS front end.\nAlthough I had no knowledge of most of these technologies coming into the internship, I\nwas able to teach myself by reading the documentation and completed the project in a\ntimely manner and to high standards. At school I have worked on several team projects\nwhich could easily be applied to the real world. For example, for my databases class, we\ncreated from scratch a PostgreSQL database and populated it with data found online. We\nthen developed a web application which accessed the information stored in the database,\nperforming filters, aggregations, and sorts using a graphical user interface. In my AI\nclass, one of my projects involved developing an AI solver for the popular game 2048.\nThis included utilization of several heuristics and tree search algorithms.\nI consider myself very adaptive to new environments and a quick learner. Before my\ninternship, I only knew Java as it was the language my computer science classes at\nColumbia were taught in. I learned Python in under a month and also have a comfortable\ngrip in JavaScript after my experience of working with Node.js and AngularJS. Over the\npast years I have attended nine school in six cities and four countries. Each time I have\nbeen able to quickly adapt and achieve highly. After merely two years in France, I have\nattained a conversational level of French. Having participated in various speech\ncompetitions and Model United Nations during high school, I am also a strong verbal\ncommunicator.\nThank you for taking into consideration my resume and cover letter and I look forward\nfor a possible opportunity for an interview in the future.\nSincerely yours,\nHao YanEnglish (native), Mandarin (native), Cantonese (fluent), French (fluent)\nComputing Skills\nJava, Python, SQL, MongoDB, JavaScript, Node.js, AngularJS, HTML, C/C++(currently taking courses),\nUnix, Git\n61-63 WEST 108T H STREET, APT4C, NEW YORK, NY10025 (646)512-4616\nHY2372@COLUMBIA.EDU\nNovember 20, 2016\nPromantus\nDear Sir or Madam,\nI learned about this full time job opportunity through the Columbia University Center for\nCareer Education website.
